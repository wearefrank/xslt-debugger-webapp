XSLT-Debugger webapp
===================

A simple webapp to test the functionalities of the XSLT-Debugger.
See https://github.com/wearefrank/ladybug on how to install and run it. 
It works the same way as ladybug-test-webapp except that you also need to install and build the XSLT-Debugger repo found here: https://github.com/wearefrank/xslt-debugger
